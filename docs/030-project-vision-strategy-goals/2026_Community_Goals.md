## AsyncAPI Community Building Goals and Objectives for 2026
It's time to discuss the goals for building and maintaining the AsyncAPI community in 2026. Our focus for 2026 will be intentional; we will prioritize one core goal â€” **increasing the number of maintainers**. Alongside this, we will reassess our community's structure and programs to ensure alignment, sustainability, and impact. The Community Manager will play an important role in ensuring that our goals are addressed and that each program or initiative has a dedicated person responsible.

To also ensure structure in our community goals, we will be using the Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Measures (GOSM) framework to track our progress throughout the year.

### Goal

Increase the number of active maintainers and support current maintainers in their efforts.

### Objectives
- O1: Increase the number of maintainers from 70 to [whatever number we come up with here] by the end of 2026.
- O2: Remove all the inactive repositories by Q2 2026.
- O3: Improve the effectiveness of working groups by establishing two new active groups by the end of Q3 2026.
