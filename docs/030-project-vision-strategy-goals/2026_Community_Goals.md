## AsyncAPI Community Building Goals and Objectives for 2026
It's time to discuss the goals for building and maintaining the AsyncAPI community in 2026. Our focus for 2026 will be intentional; we will prioritize one core goal — **increasing the number of maintainers**. Alongside this, we will reassess our community's structure and programs to ensure alignment, sustainability, and impact. The Community Manager will play an important role in ensuring that our goals are addressed and that each program or initiative has a dedicated person responsible.

To also ensure structure in our community goals, we will be using the Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Measures (GOSM) framework to track our progress throughout the year.

### Goal

Increase the number of active maintainers and support current maintainers in their efforts.

### Objectives
- **O1**: Increase the number of maintainers from 70 to [whatever number we come up with here] by the end of 2026.
- **O2**: Remove all the inactive repositories by Q2 2026.
- **O3**: Improve the effectiveness of working groups by establishing two new active groups by the end of Q3 2026.

### Strategies
-**S1: Repository Audit & Consolidation** (Targets O1, O2): Conduct a clear audit of all 49 repositories to identify active maintainers, consolidate inactive repos, and identify critical ones. Move inactive maintainers to an Emeritus role.
- **S2: Improve the Maintainer Process** (Targets O1): Update the maintainer process and requirements. Mandate that each critical repository has at least 2-3 active maintainers to prevent bus factor and burnout. Educate maintainers on the Maintainership Initiative.
- **S3: Working Group Cleanup** (Targets O3): Clean up inactive working groups and channels. Improve guidelines for new groups, including a requirement for multiple active chairs, [completion of the Linux Foundation training course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/leading-high-performance-working-group-meetings-lfc120), and quarterly reports on the AsyncAPI blog.
- **S4: Enhance the Maintainership Program** (Targets O1): Pause the in-house Mentorship program (is this the one you meant?) in 2026. Improve coordination with GSoC and explore LFX Mentorship. Establish a dedicated Maintainership Working Group to imporve all aspects of the program.
- **S5: The AsyncAPU Bounty Program** (Targets O1): Establish a budget schedule for the Bounty Program and improve efficiency.
- **S6: Organize the AsyncAPI Conference 2026** (Targets O1): Improve venue selection, continue with the work on the API Standards Booth, and improve the conference prospectus for sponsors.
- **S7: Manage the Ambassador Program** (Targets O1): Continue monthly Ambassador meetings and identify additional Ambassadors to support the program.
- **S8: Launch the Fellowship Program** (Targets O1): Lay the groundwork for the new program by creating documentation on its purpose and eligibility. Research and discuss criteria for selecting projects and create a communication plan.
- **S9: Enhance Sponsor Relationships and Outreach** (Targets O1): Develop a clear value proposition for sponsors that goes beyond altruism. This includes identifying companies that depend on AsyncAPI, building and nurturing relationships with them at events and through ongoing communication, and defining clear sponsorship tiers that offer tangible benefits.


### Measures:
- **M1**: Number of active maintainers.
- **M2**: Number of inactive repositories.
- **M3**: Number of active working groups.
- **M4**: Number of quarterly reports published on the blog.
- **M5**: Number of participants in GSoC and LFX Mentorship.
- **M6**: Budget utilization for the Bounty Program.
- **M7**: Conference attendance and sponsor revenue.
- **M8**: Number of active Ambassadors.
- **M9**: Number of sponsors
- **M10**: Total amount of annual sponsorship revenue.

### Summary
2026 is a year of focus, consolidation, and strengthening the foundation. We’re dedicated to ensuring AsyncAPI continues to scale sustainably while empowering the people behind it. 
These efforts will coordinate under the Community Working Group umbrella, with execution led by Community Builders [Ace](https://github.com/AceTheCreator) (Maintainership Program), [Ash](https://github.com/aeworxet) (Bounty Program), [Łukasz](https://github.com/derberg) (Fellowship Program), and [Thulie](https://github.com/thulieblack) (AsyncAPI Conference and Ambassador Program), and supported by the wider AsyncAPI community.
